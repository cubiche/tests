# Cubiche\Tests

This library provides tools to create and run tests for Cubiche components.

In each component, a `Tests/` directory contains test suites. So far, only unit
tests are supported. They are written with [atoum](http://atoum.org/).

## Installation

With [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), to include this library into your
dependencies, you need to require [`cubiche/tests`](https://packagist.org/packages/cubiche/tests):

```json
{
    "require": {
        "cubiche/tests": "dev-master"
    }
